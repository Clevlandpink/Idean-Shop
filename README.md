Unfortunaly I don't have the time to work on this anymore but since people have been asking for it here it is. I have not had the chance to simplify the setup process so I am explaining it here.

# Setup:
1. Download Idean_Shop_2.txt.
2. Place in **_"Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\data\expression2"_**
3. Find and place E2 chip in game.
4. Wire __EGP__ and __User__ to your EGP screen.
5. Place two GPS forming a box around your shipments and then wire __GPS1__ and __GPS2__ to them.
6. Spawn user and angle beam towards ground then wire __Fire__ from the user to __Muser__, finally wire __UserM__ from chip to user.
